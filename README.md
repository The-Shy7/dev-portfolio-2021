# Personal Developer Portfolio

## Description

This is my personal developer portfolio presenting my resume and a small sample of the projects I have worked on. The site was built with React (front-end JavaScript library), Gatsby (static site generator), GraphQL (query language for APIs), Bootstrap (front-end UI library), and Sass (CSS extension language). 

This is still a work in progress. Once everything is finalized and finished, I plan to deploy the site (I am not sure which service at the moment since I am considering multiple options).
