# Personal Developer Portfolio

## Description

This is my personal developer portfolio presenting my resume and a small sample of the projects I have worked on. The site was built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) (front-end JavaScript library), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) (static site generator), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) (query language for APIs), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) (front-end UI library), and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) (CSS extension language).

I plan to deploy the site (I am not sure which service at the moment since I am considering multiple options).
